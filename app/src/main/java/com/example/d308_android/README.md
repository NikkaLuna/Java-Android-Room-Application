# ANDROID VACATION PLANNER APP

The Android Vacation Planner App saves all your vacation details, making them available to you for reference anytime you need them. Using the Android Vacation Planner App, you can create vacations, update them anytime you make changes, and and delete them if your plans change.  Add as many vacations as you need.

## FEATURES

- **View your Vacation:** This app shows you the details of each vacation, including the title, location, start and end date, and any excursions associated with it.
