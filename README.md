ANDROID VACATION PLANNER APP
 
SCENARIO
 
The Android Vacation Planner App simplifies the process of planning your vacations and associated excursions, ensuring that all your vacation details are saved and available for future reference. 
 
FEATURES:
 
‚Ä¢      With the Android Vacation Planner App, you can create, update, and delete Vacations.  Add as many vacations as you need, update them with any changes, and delete them when they are either past or when your plans have changed. 
‚Ä¢      Vacation View: The Android Vacation Planner App View displays all the details of each vacation, including the title, location, start and end dates, and associated excursions. You can also edit and delete vacation information from this view.
‚Ä¢      Excursion Management: Keep track of each excursion that you add to your vacation.  You can add, update, and delete excursions as needed, ensuring that your itinerary is seamlessly scheduled and tracked.
‚Ä¢      Vacation Alerts: Set alerts for the days when your vacation starts and ends.  This feature is also available for excursion dates so that you never miss an important activity.  The app prevents you from accidentally entering dates with incorrect formatting and prevents you from accidentally trying to schedule an excursion outside of your scheduled vacation.  
‚Ä¢      Share Vacations with Friends and Family: Easily share vacation details with others via email, clipboard, or SMS using the built-in sharing feature.
